	<overview>The Playstation 4 is the successor to Sony&amp;#039;s Playstation 3 console. Moving away from the Cell architecture, the PlayStation 4 will be the first in the Sony series to feature compatibility with the x86 architecture, specifically x86-64, which is a widely used platform common in many modern PCs. The idea is to make video game development easier on the next-generation console, attracting a broader range of developers large and small. These changes highlight Sony&amp;#039;s effort to improve upon the lessons learned during the development, production and release of the PS3. Other notable hardware features of the PS4 include 8 GB of memory and a faster Blu-ray drive.
