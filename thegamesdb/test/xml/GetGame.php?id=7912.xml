<Overview>X³: Reunion is a single-player space trading and combat game developed by Egosoft and published by Deep Silver. It is the third installment in the X universe adventure video game series.
X³: Reunion incorporates open-ended "sandbox" gameplay. The main quest can be postponed or ignored as the player explores the expansive universe and spends the most time in control of a ship, doing tasks of their own choosing. Different ships are available for various tasks: small, fast scouting ships; freighters; powerful battleships; and massive carriers for moving a fleet. Most ships seen in the game can be bought or captured, and flown by the player. The player is free to go anywhere in the X-Universe at any time and explore, complete plot-related goals or to fulfill their own personal goals.</Overview>
