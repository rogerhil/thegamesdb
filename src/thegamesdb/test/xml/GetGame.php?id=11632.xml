<Overview>X-Men: Mutant Academy 2 is a fighting game featuring characters from the X-Men universe. In this sequel to X-Men: Mutant Academy, six new X-Men characters join the ranks, including Rogue, Forge, Nightcrawler, Havok, and two secret fighters. Six new arenas - the X-Mansion, Muir Island, an eerily lit church and Asteroid M (Magneto's Stage), plus two secret levels, have been added.

The sequel also introduces a so-called "Cerebro mode", where the player can check out behind-the-scenes character sketches, costume designs and movie set sketches from the X-Men movie. Professor X himself teaches the player the many moves available to the character in the Academy Training mode.</Overview>
