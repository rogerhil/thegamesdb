<Overview>GoldenEye X is an enhanced version of the original GoldenEye 007 game for the Nintendo 64. It uses the Perfect Dark engine, which allows for new and exciting things not possible before. Here's just a few of these welcome features... 

Voice-Overs: 
If you're one of those people who don't like to read captions in games, than you'll be happy to know that voices are now supported. Instead of reading the conversations Bond has with other characters, you'll get to hear them. Doesn't that sound good? 

Weather: 
Not only can the sun or moon appear in the sky, it's also possible to trigger either rain or snow effects. This adds a whole new dimension to maps like the Surface. 

Interactive Lighting: 
Wasn't it a nice diversion running around the Bunker, shooting out all of the light fixtures? In GEX, the lights can actually go out. This might make you think twice before entering the darkness. 

Clipping &amp; AI Sighting: 
Your enemies now have the ability to see through and over railings, allowing them to send a wave of bullets your way. You know how great hiding behind railings was in a level like Caverns? You won't be so lucky this time around. 

Cooperative &amp; Counter-Operative Missions: 
If playing through the missions wasn't fun enough, now you'll be able to have a friend join in. Whether they are there to assist you, or are there to stop you from reaching your goals, is entirely your decision. 

Virtual Reality (Multiplayer): 
Remember how amazing the multiplayer was in GoldenEye? Well, picture that same incredible gaming experience, but throw in up to eight computer controlled opponents. Better customization over the match options, great scenarios (including King of the Hill and Capture the Flag), your choice of head and body, music preferences, and more. About the only thing you can't do, is prevent your buddies from choosing Oddjob. 


Where can you download GoldenEye X? You can find the most recent public patches at the GoldenEye Vault website. If you aren't familiar with it already, here is the link...

We hope that you'll take the time to download the patch and test out the game. It's a labour of love, done only to improve upon what can easily be considered a masterpiece. If GoldenEye wasn't already the best FPS of a generation, perhaps this will be. 

Thank you for taking an interest in this project.
